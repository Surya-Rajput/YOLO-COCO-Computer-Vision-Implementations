# YOLO-COCO-Computer-Vision-Implementations


This repository contains implementations of various computer vision algorithms, with a specific focus on object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) on the COCO (Common Objects in Context) dataset. This covers the implementation of several computer vision algorithms and object detection techniques using OpenCV.

### Questions

1. **Implement the Harris algorithm using OpenCV.** 

2. **Implement Image Pyramid using OpenCV.** 

3. Choose one of the following:
   - **Implement the SURF algorithm using OpenCV.**
   - **Implement Image Segmentation with Watershed Algorithm using OpenCV.**

4. **Implement SIFT algorithm using OpenCV.** 

5. **Implement object detection using YOLO on the COCO dataset. Provide the results for any 5 images (for testing purposes) from the dataset.**
